# DiscordBotTemplate
This is a application meant to be run inside a container that has all required packages installed to run the discord.py library.

## Getting Started

Run the following:
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

This will make a copy of .env, and edit the environment variables to be the correct values.
`.env` is in `.gitignore`, so when you save your progress with git, the secrets in
this file won't be saved.
